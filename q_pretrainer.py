# agent_DQN: Trains a Deep Convolutional Network given a CSV file containing
#            multi-feaure timeseries data, with a window of time per feature
#            with consecutive ticks per feature and reward data per action.
#            The reward data is the training signal and multiple training
#            (ml model, optimization methods) models are used, performs ARIMA

## \class QAgent
## \brief Q-Learning agent that uses an OpenAI gym environment for fx trading 
##  This agent has separate networks (Pre-trained DeepConvNets) for estimating 
##  each action per step of the simulation environment.

    ## init method
    ## Loads the training and validation datasets, loads the pre-trained models
    #  initialize forex environment.
